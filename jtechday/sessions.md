### WebServices & JAX - WS
***
Webservices enable applications to share information, irrespective of the platform and environment. Drivers major B2B, and B2C applications. In this Presentation, we will see the basics of webservices - Motivation, Architecture and Components; relevance with XML; why, where and how XML is connected with Webservices. The presentation also highlights the JAX-WS. We shall undergo a demo of publishing a webservice in 10 minutes and consuming a webservice in 10 minutes. We will use SOAP-UI, a generic webservices client used to explore webservices. We will go through the steps of PUBLISH - EXPLORE - CONSUME, and the motivation ; building blocks of webservices.

### JBoss Application Server 7
***
JBoss Application Server 7 is a significant release  in JBOSS application server series. JBOSS AS 7 has been rewritten from scratch, and the key features are optimized boot process, modular classloading, module services container, centralized/unified configuration and management, Strict compliance to Java EE6 etc.

This presentation discusses the motivation behind JBoss AS 7 and the major differences between the new JBoss AS and its previous incarnations, with an emphasis on core technologies such as the modular classloading and the concurrent service container.

### JavaFX 2: Rich Client Platform
***
Most client applications today are browser based and use HTML CSS Javascript. However we often find that these applications lack the richness of native desktop applications. Can Java reload desktop application like rich interfaces while also providing modern features & capabilities? Is JavaFX the answer?

This session will deep dive into JavaFX starting with a look at the history of JavaFX before and after Oracle acquisition.It will look at the features and benefits of JavaFX,  what is FXML and SceneBuilder and using  JavaFX with other languages.

###Scala Hands-on Lab
***
This handson session is for Scala a Object Functional JVM language.The session walks through step-by-step of the fundementals and using mixture of OO and Functional aspects of Scala. Attendees can code alongside as we walkthrough the slides.By the end of the session people can get started with coding and build apps API's etc.

_As a prerequestite you are required to get ready with your laptop with Eclipse 3.6 with scalaIDE (a plugin for Eclipse) installed._


###  Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) in JEE6
***
CDI is new addition in JEE6, an emerging standard for dependency injection (DI) and interception (AOP). It is evident from the popularity of DI and AOP that Java needs to address DI and AOP so that it can build other standards on top of it. DI and AOP are the foundation of many Java frameworks.The annotation driven programming of CDI makes it easy to build dependent objects easy and extensible.

The session takes a tour of varous features of CDI, the annotations and its various aspects with more real life examples. This gives audience a better idea of the usage in developing JEE6 applications.

### Android CustomViews
***
This hands on will introduce attendees to the concept of building custom android view components.The session will go into the depths of creating the view based on existing views, and reacting to events. At the end of this session attendees will be able build views only limited by their imagination.

### Aparapi - an Introduction
***
Aparapi is an Open Source tool for extending the Java promise of ‘Write Once Run
Anywhere’ to include the GPU.An API used to express data parallel workloads in Java and a runtime system capable of running compatible workloads on a
compatible GPU. The advantages include Data Parallelism for Java Developers. It allows java developers to exploit the compute power of GPU and APU.

### VisageFX: DSL for JavaFX
***
Visage is a domain specific language (DSL) designed specifically for writing user interfaces. Visage is Statically Compiled Language. Visage application models the user interface you are designing both in appearance and function. Visage is similar to JavaFX1.3 script  and there are equivalent API for writing GUI application using VisageFX. VisageFX is useful in order to describe a scene graph similar to JavaFX but in more efficient and natural way. VisageFX can also be termed as a Programming language which natural, efficient and effective.
Presentation Outline are  Learn about Visage. Know about different places it's used today (Vaadin,Android, VisageFX etc.). How can you minimize code to create effective UI for VisageFX You will learn to build beautiful UI just in matter of few minutes.
