### JavaFX 2: Rich Client Platform
***
Most client applications today are browser based and use HTML CSS Javascript. However we often find that these applications lack the richness of native desktop applications. Can Java reload desktop application like rich interfaces while also providing modern features & capabilities? Is JavaFX the answer?

This session will deep dive into JavaFX starting with a look at the history of JavaFX before and after Oracle acquisition.It will look at the features and benefits of JavaFX,  what is FXML and SceneBuilder and using  JavaFX with other languages.

### Android CustomViews
***
This hands on will introduce attendees to the concept of building custom android view components.The session will go into the depths of creating the view based on existing views, and reacting to events.

VisageFX can also be termed as a Programming language which natural, efficient and effective.
Presentation Outline are  Learn about Visage. Know about different places it's used today (Vaadin,Android, VisageFX etc.). How can you minimize code to create effective UI for VisageFX You will learn to build beautiful UI just in matter of few minutes.
